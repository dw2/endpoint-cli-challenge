Thank you for the opportunity to complete your code challenge.
There was one last bug i was working on when I ran out of time,
however I am fairly happy with the results. This was my first
time creating a CLI, and I had a lot of fun working on it.

Run `yarn install` or `node install`
Then run `node . test` to execute the test commands

Single commands can be run with 
  + `node . list`
  + `node . create value`
  + `node . delete value`
  + `node . move value newValue`
  + `node . clear`
